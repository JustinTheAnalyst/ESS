Salaam-o-alaikum, Abdulwahhab!
I've custom-built the search fields on my website (WordPress) to match the database which I've developed from multiple data sources. Unsurprisingly, I failed to upload the CSV file to Wordpress.
 My goal is to let my web-users be able to search this large database using specific variables (or fields such as income, education ...etc.) which are not initially included in the theme I am using. 
The attached Excel file should further clarify what I need. Note that the fields shaded in grey are the original theme's fields (search + results). The fields shaded in light-blue are added fields which I want them to appear as results. The fields shaded in green are the search fields that I added.
Is this something you could help me with? If so, how much does this service cost? 
Looking forward to hearing from you.Thanks!

3) Problem: Results do not show when searching the database using specific added variables/fields.

The database's fields/variables/columns are not read or understood by WordPress because the search fields (I built by myself using Search Field Builder) are not the default fields and do not match the fields in the database I am trying to upload. 

Goal: To let my website users search a large database using specific variables (or fields such as income, education ...etc.) which are not initially included in the theme I am using. 
The theme was developed for real estate agents listing their properties for sale/rent. My website is not a real estate listings website so the fields/variables users search are different. 

The attached Excel file should further clarify what I need. Note that the fields shaded in grey are the original theme's fields (search + results). The fields shaded in light-blue are added fields which I want them to appear as results. The fields shaded in green are the search fields that I added.


It'd also be great if you could simplify adding new search fields/variables so that I could add new variables in the future without needing to go over this process.


Hopefully this clarifies what is required. 


Thank!
